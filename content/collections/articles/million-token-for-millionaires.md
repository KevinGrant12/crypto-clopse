Interpret that how you want, but that was not the most exciting thing for me to hear. However, this is mostly a non-issue for followers who have grown to know him as a family man (ex-husband, ex-google, ex-facebook tech lead) and are familiar with his ability to manage money and businesses. His users come for the developer content, but they stay for the sarcastic arrogance, controversial headlines, and heart-felt stories.'

Part of the reason  he has been able to sustain such a following is because he really puts himself out there and shares his personal life with the audience. TechLeads engineering background allows him to interpret things in ways most other people cannot or will not. This is his most valuable skill as he transitions into the cryptocurrency space. Speaking of space and dumping your money into black holes, let''s explore the length one must travel to acquire such a commodity.'
