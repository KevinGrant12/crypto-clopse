        text: 'SafeMoon is a fairly new cryptocurrency that rewards long-term investment by redistributing a percentage of each transaction to it''s holders. Anytime someone buys or sells there is a 10% fee. 5% goes to all holders, while the other 5% is permanently "burned." Personally, I have accumulated around 30 million coins in under a month just from being a holder. That is just the bird''s eye view. Let''s zoom in and see what fuels this rocket.'

        text: 'Since its initial launch on PancakeSwap in early March of 2021, the SafeMoon community has grown to a wapping 285,000 holders with hundreds of more followers on social avenues like Twitter and Discord. SafeMoon is registered as an LLC and the team has been highly active within the growing community including holding many AMA''s ( ask me anything ) and rapidly updating their website with statistics, a roadmap, merchandise, educational features, and much more. Ok, sounds like a white-hot start, but will the value of the coin grow beyond just market speculation?'

        text: 'SafeMoon is a deflationary coin meaning the number of coins in existence will decrease over time. At the time of writing this article, April 05 of 2021, SafeMoon has burned roughly 400 trillion coins and swiftly counting. This means that the intrinsic value of the coin should steadily grow over time as the availability decreases.'

Even some high-ranking members, such as CTO Thomas (Papa) Smith, refuse to hold SafeMoon in order to avoid any conflicts of interest. In just the last month, I have witnessed the SafeMoon team grow to 50+ individuals with an eclectic skillset.  Let''s take a look at the leadership:'
