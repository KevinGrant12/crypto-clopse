preview: 'Ethereum is the Godzilla of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has many weapons, it is decentralized and fluid, and it does millions of dollars of damage to everyones wallet. Were you expecting Bitcoin to have that title? Not on my watch. Bitcoin is more of a King Kong: unnatural in size, also decentralized yet can somehow be manipulated by a single human, and it does not have a single weapon other than sheer size and people starring at it with jaws dropped. Do you disagree?'

        text: 'Speaking of soul-sucking suspense, Ethereum 2.0 is on the horizon and has the potential to hammer the final nail into Bitcoins coffin. A bit of hyperbole, but that could actually happen if Bitcoins blockchain does not make some major upgrades. Ethereum has a long chain of future plans, as well as an even longer list of companies itching to hop on and blast their projects into production. Mostly rainbows and sunshine it would seem. This comes in stark contrast to Bitcoin, a black and white TV with a million channels you can''t watch. Who is this fierce yet bland competitor?'
