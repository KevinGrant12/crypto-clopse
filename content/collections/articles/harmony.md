        text: 'Harmony ( ONE ) is a dynamic sharding protocol designed to enhance the scalability and decentralization of Ethereum projects. The sharding mechanism relieves congestion by storing data in "shards" that exist outside of the main blockchain. They call it "decentralization at scale" and are extremely confident in its performance.'

        text: 'Stephen Tse, the founder & CEO of Harmony, believes that existing cryptocurrency platforms have yet to deliver decentralization and extensibility in a balanced blockchain experience. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zilliqa have all been called out by the Harmony team for having increasing transction fees, sluggish operations, and a variety of security flaws - much of like the U.S. government. Do you disagree? Of course not. Harmony just wants love, peace, and a reliable smart contract platform. Are these outlandish desires or will Harmony set the bar for crypto platforms of the future?'

        text: 'As a Layer-2 solution, Harmony is sandwiched between the blockchain and Ethereum applications. It offers enhancements of gas-efficiency and speedy settlements and has a trustless Ethereum bridge that enables interoperability with Ethereums ecosystem. Think of it like and Iron Man suite for Ethereum. In order to understand its need for war-armor, let''s peer into Ethereums soul.'

        text: ' If you have ever interacted with Ethereums blockchain, then you know the agony of high costs, latency, and sluggish contract finality. During each transaction, your hard-earned money is suspended in the "ether" ( pun always intended ) for an eerie amount of time and finality times are pretty inconsistent. This can hinder trust in the network and make it less approachable. Harmony, on the other claw, is shoving 2 second finality time in Ethereums face. '
