It is now the kid on the playground who stood up to the bully and got everyones lunch money back. Bitcoin can be that bully for our purposes. BTC is the oldest, largest, richest kid on the playground. But like most tough guys, there''s not much going on upstairs. It''s good for muscling the market around and causing some uproar, but if it you want a cup of coffee you''ll have to wait just a little ( a lot ) longer and pay just a little ( a lot ) more than if you asked literally any other student.'

It has become a competition of who can tack on the most zeros after the decimal when they become liquid. Fine, I''ll bite, many times. Who doesn''t love a good hook? The price is so low, how could you not make money?'

I was up $40,000 at one point from something like a $500 investment. That was an unnatural spike though, as is the pattern with most altcoins in their infancy. However, the holders keep going up and up, damn near building the ladder to the moon themselves. 2,426,517 holders at the time writing this, to be precise.
