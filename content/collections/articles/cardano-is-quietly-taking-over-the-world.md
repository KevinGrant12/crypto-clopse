It''s pretty hard to take over the world if the world does not know who you are. Cardano is one of my top investments and yet half the people reading this article probably don''t know much about them. Is this an area of neglect for the company or could it be strategic by every measure?'

This allows them to work in a more  "modular" way in which they can complete tasks more efficiently AND be more reactive to issues when they arise.'
