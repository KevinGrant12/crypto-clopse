        text: 'Is it just me, or does Bitcoin smell like actual shit? Joking, this is not a hit piece and Bitcoin is cool, but I needed to wow you and it worked. I strongly believe that altcoins will overtake the crypto big dogs and provide the world with a diverse menu of awesome ways to spend and utilize your cryptocurrencies. It will be like a candy store for kids AND adults, and anyone who likes chucking cash into a black hole. You know, that bag of tricks.'

        text: 'SafeMoon is a great coin to start with to maximize potential of variety and success in your crypto portfolio. That is not financial advice, but it is financial stuff... that I do... that you might also want to do ( completely of your own free will ). And, there''s great news! SafeMoon has not crashed landed. We are kind of stuck in the atmosphere right now, but safe from crashing down to earth, especially after dumping some huge whales recently.  If you got in early, you likely saw some colossal gains followed by some heaping losses. So what if you could have paid off your car or bought a house? Who cares if you could have quit your job and moved do Dubai or started your retirement at the age of 30. The important thing to remember, is that you could have been rich, but fucked that up, but you may be rich in the future.'
