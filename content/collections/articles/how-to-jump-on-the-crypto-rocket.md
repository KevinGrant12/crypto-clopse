Jumping into the mysterious world of cryptocurrency can be overwhelming to say the least. An entire new industry is blasting off before your eyes but the keys to the rocket are hidden behind controversial exchanges strange terms like "stop-loss" and "margins." Where and how can you safely enter the market without risking too much of that hard earned cash and dignity?

## Experience
First, consider your experience. Are you a savvy investor who drinks rocket fuel for breakfast or are you hoping crypto will be the one that pops your investing cherry? Do the terms "fundemantal" or "technical analysis" resonate with you or do you drool when terms related to money pass through the canyon in your skull? 

**Why it matters:** If you start pooring money into random cryptos and exchanges, you are likely to get bullied while other kids eat your lunch. You need to understand the risks involved with gambling -that's what it is- and recognize your own tolerance for pain. On the other end of things, consider how you will act if you do find yourself riding crypto rocket to the moon. Will you panick and sell before you leave the atmosphere? Ride the wave all the to Val Halla? Succumb to the pump to Val Halla, only to find yourself on a detour to Loki's sex dungeon...wait what? The point is, crypto is more volatile than your grandma's bowels on spaghetti night while watching Wheel of Fortune. Understanding the flow of the graph takes time, patience, and the ability to sleep with a rock in your stomach.

**The good news:** Regardless of your experience, crypto remains a mere sperm in shadow of what it will be in the future. A couple of low risk investments now could launch you to Mars in your own personal cash rocket in a matter of days, weeks, or years. The market provides equal opportunities for everyone to take their investments to the moon or bury themselves in a gambling frenzy all the like. It's your drug, take it the way you like it!

## Goals
Personally, I like to buy a puppy, feed it, teach it tricks, and watch it   grow. Others like to purchase the fully trained, price-winning beauty and take it straight to the races for some quick gains. Many people are a hybrid of the two though - not quite a deep sea diver but kiddy pools gross you out.

**Long Term Example:** My current endeavor is based around VeChain and it's henchman known as Vethor Token (VET+VTHO). Both are currently trading well under a dollar, but I was lucky enough to grab a couple hundred thousand VTHO while it was still under a penny. In the past few years, VeChain has broke it's Ethereum bonds and now has massive technological aspirations on it's own platform. They are carving our their own nich in the smart-contract industry by targeting mainly supply chains. This is the perfect example of a low-risk ticket to space. Keep in mind, rockets can always crash. But once they hit the atmosphere, they usually don't come back down.

## Capital - And I don't Mean Letters



## Market Awareness
Currently, Bitcoin dictates the market like King Kong holding on to a blonde. It can drop the crypto market on a dime or carry it to peaks that humans have yet to discover. It's current behavior seems to enjoy both - what a bitch.

Because altcoins can be traded in such small quantities, the volatility of the market is radical. Pump and dump schemes are coming out of the woodworks and are making millionaires overnight. But get caught sleeping and you could become the Red Riding Hood that actually got eaten. There seems to be a new cryptocurrency every week and they are all fighting to dominate the market. Some solve real-world problems, like Cardano (ADA), and others are there just for show like Dogecoin (DOGE). Understanding the purpose of each crypto before buying is vital to your success. Some are better suited for holding while others may be primed for an overnight trip to the moon and back.
